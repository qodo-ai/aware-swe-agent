## 📦 Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/aware-swe-agent.git
cd aware-swe-agent
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

You also need API access to [Aware](https://aware.dev) and optionally an OpenAI or Ollama-compatible model.

## 🧪 Usage

Run the agent on a repository and an issue:

```bash
python run.py --repo_path ./example-repo --issue "Fix broken pagination on /orders route"
```

Advanced options:

```bash
--aware_api_key <YOUR_KEY>      # Required
--llm_provider openai|ollama    # Optional
--plan_mode tree|sequential     # Optional planning strategy
```
